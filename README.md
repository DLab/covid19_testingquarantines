# COVID-19 SUPPRESSION USING A TESTING/QUARANTINE STRATEGY: 
## A MULTI-PARADIGM SIMULATION APPROACH BASED ON A SEIRTQ COMPARTMENTAL MODEL
This repository contains the mutliparadigm simulations that produced the results presented in this paper published in the proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference 2022.

## Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)
The ODE simulations where performed using the [cv19gm library](https://github.com/DLab/covid19geomodeller)

## Agent Based Models
The agents based simulations where performed using the [Net-Logo library](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)
